# Custom Front-End Project

## Overview

This project is a **custom front-end** developed from a given design. The goal was to faithfully replicate the visual design while ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience across devices.

The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to ensure performance and simplicity.

## Features

- **Custom Design**: The front-end was built entirely from scratch based on a provided design, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy and design fidelity.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: The website is optimized to work on modern browsers.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: The code is structured for easy readability and maintainability, using semantic HTML and modular CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For the design and styling, including media queries for responsive behavior.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For any dynamic functionality and interactivity.
